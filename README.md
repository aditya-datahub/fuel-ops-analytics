# ⛽ FuelGuard — Fraud Detection & Customer Analytics Pipeline

> End-to-end fraud detection pipeline — identified **27.5% fraud rate** & **16,200L under-dispensing** across 50 fuel stations using Python, PostgreSQL & Power BI

---

## 📌 Overview

Fuel stations across India lose significant revenue due to **sensor-based fraud** — where pumps dispense less fuel than what customers pay for. This project builds a complete analytics pipeline to:

- Detect fraud patterns using transaction & sensor data
- Understand how fraud impacts customer retention
- Identify high-risk stations and cities
- Validate 3 business hypotheses through data

## 📊 Dataset

| Table | Rows | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| transactions | 1,00,000 | Fuel transactions with fraud flags |
| customers | 5,000 | Customer type & signup info |
| stations | 50 | Station details across 3 cities |
| sensor_data | 1,00,000 | Expected vs actual fuel dispensed |

**Cities covered:** Delhi • Mumbai • Bangalore

> 📝 All data is synthetically simulated using Python with realistic distributions and fraud patterns.

## 🔬 Hypotheses Tested

| # | Hypothesis | Result |
|---|-----------|--------|
| H1 | Fraud transactions reduce customer repeat visits | ✅ Proved — Fraud: 18% vs Clean: 36% repeat rate |
| H2 | Higher wait time leads to lower customer retention | ✅ Proved — Low: 34% → Medium: 33% → High: 30% |
| H3 | Frequent customers have higher repeat rate | ✅ Proved — Frequent: 48% vs Occasional: 24% |

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- 🔴 **Delhi** has the highest fraud rate at **51.2%** — double that of Mumbai (16.2%)
- 🚨 **9 stations** identified with **96%+ fraud rate**
- ⛽ **16,200 liters** of fuel physically under-dispensed across flagged transactions
- 📉 Fraud transactions lead to **50% lower repeat visits** (18% vs 36%)
- ⏱️ Peak hours (8–11 AM, 5–8 PM) show highest wait times and lowest retention

## ⚙️ How to Run

**1. Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aditya-datahub/fuel-analytics-fraud-detection.git
cd fuel-analytics-fraud-detection
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Run the notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/fuel_station_analytics.ipynb
```

> Running the notebook will automatically generate processed files:
> `sensor_fraud_mixed.csv`, `sensor_fraud_all.csv`, `stations_summary.csv`

**4. Open Power BI Dashboard**

Open `dashboard/fuel_dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
